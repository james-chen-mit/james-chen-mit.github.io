Welcome to my in-progress website! I'm James and I'm an incoming PhD student in MIT EECS. I'm very excited to exploring my interests across learning, control and optimization over the course of my PhD. In particular, I'm currently interested in how we can apply machine learning to control in a robust manner, particularly for power grid applications.

I graduated from Caltech in June 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
